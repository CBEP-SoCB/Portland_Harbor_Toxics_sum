## Introduction
Dredging of accumulated sediment is an important maintenance activity for many
coastal businesses.  Yet areas around many private and public piers in Portland
Harbor have not been dredged for decades. This has significantly reduced the
number of available slips, as shoaling has made slips too shallow for use.

The reason slips and other waters have not been dredged is that the
sediments that accumulated in these waters over the years contains a mix of 
toxic contaminants derived from urban runoff, historical waterfront industries 
and other sources.

The City of Portland and the Portland Harbor Commission have been working for 
years to find a solution for safe disposal of contaminated and potentially 
contaminated sediments.   Recently, several federal grants allowed the Harbor
Commission to commission studies and engineering to design for a "Confined 
Aquatic Disposal" (CAD) Cell.  A CAD cell is a deep hole dug in clean sediment 
of the harbor, into which contaminated or potentially contaminated sediments may 
be deposited, as an environmentally preferable alternative to "loose" deep
ocean disposal, which risks substantial exposure of marine organisms to 
whatever contaminants are present in the sediments.

As part of the design process, the Portland Harbor Commission requested a study
looking at the concentration of toxic contaminants in Portland Harbor sediments.  
Specifically, they looked at the concentration of persistent organic 
contaminants and metals in pairs of "deep" ( ~ 2 meter long) cores of mud from
16 locations where dredging was planned.

The data we review here is derived from the results of that study.

Data was provided to CBEP by staff at Stantec.  Stantec was the lead contractor
on much of the environmental analysis associated with the Portland Harbor
Commmission's work developing the CAD Cell program designs.

## Screening Values
We found a plethora of potential screening values in  NOAA's SQuiRT Cards 
(Screening Quick Reference Tables), which are available multiple places on-line 
including here: https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/9327

Supplementary information on the SQuiRTs is available here:
https://response.restoration.noaa.gov/environmental-restoration/environmental-assessment-tools/squirt-cards-faq.html

Similar screening levels are available in "Sediment Quality Guidelines"
developed for the National Status and Trends Program":
https://www.coastalscience.noaa.gov/publications/handler.aspx?key=1527

Selection of ERM and ERL as the primary criteria of interest related to use of 
those screening criteria in a recent Casco Bay Sediment Quality report,
available through the CBEP website.
