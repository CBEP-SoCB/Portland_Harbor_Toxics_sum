Analysis of persistent ("conventional") toxic contaminants in sediments from Portland Harbor, Maine

# Introduction
 
## Introduction
Dredging of accumulated sediment is an important maintenance activity for many
coastal businesses.  Yet areas around many private and public piers in Portland
Harbor have not been dredged for decades. This has significantly reduced the
number of available slips, as shoaling has made slips too shallow for use.

The reason slips and other waters have not been dredged is that the
sediments that accumulated in these waters over the years contains a mix of 
toxic contaminants derived from urban runoff, historical waterfront industries 
and other sources.

The City of Portland and the Portland Harbor Commission have been working for 
years to find a solution for safe disposal of contaminated and potentially 
contaminated sediments.   Recently, several federal grants allowed the Harbor
Commission to commission studies and engineering to design for a "Confined 
Aquatic Disposal" (CAD) Cell.  A CAD cell is a deep hole dug in clean sediment 
of the harbor, into which contaminated or potentially contaminated sediments may 
be deposited, as an environmentally preferable alternative to "loose" deep
ocean disposal, which risks substantial exposure of marine organisms to 
whatever contaminants are present in the sediments.

As part of the design process, the Portland Harbor Commission requested a study
looking at the concentration of toxic contaminants in Portland Harbor sediments.  
Specifically, they looked at the concentration of persistent organic 
contaminants and metals in pairs of "deep" ( ~ 2 meter long) cores of mud from
16 locations where dredging was planned.

Because these are "deep" cores, they represent samples of marine sediment
deposited in Portland Harbor over a period of decades.  The sediments act as a
sort of "time capsule" containing sediments deposited  when Portand had a 
far more industrial waterfront, and before most environmental laws reduced 
discharges to the Bay.

# Statement of Purpose
CBEP is committed to the ideal of open science.  Our State of the Bay data
archives ensure the science underlying the 2020/2021 State of Casco Bay report
is documented and reproducible by others. The purpose of these archives is to
release  data and data analysis code whenever possible to allow others to
review, critique, learn from, and build upon CBEP science.

# Archive Structure
CBEP 2020/2021 State of the Bay data analysis summaries contain a selection of 
data,  data analysis code, and visualization code as used to produce 
results shared via our most recent State of Casco Bay report. Usually, these
archives are organized into two or three folders, including the following:

- Data.  Contains data in simplified or derived form as used in our
data  analysis.  Associated metadata is contained in related Markdown documents,
usually `DATA_SOURCES.md` and `DATA_NOTES.md`.

- Analysis.  Contains one or more R Notebooks proceeding through the principal
data analysis steps that underpin SoCB reporting. To simplify the archives,
much preliminary analysis, and many analysis "dead ends" have been omitted. 

- Graphics.  Contains R Notebooks stepping through development of graphics, and
also copies of resulting graphics, usually in \*.png and \*.pdf formats.  These
graphics may differ from graphics as they appear in final State of the Bay
graphical layouts. Again, most draft versions of graphics have been omitted for 
clarity.
