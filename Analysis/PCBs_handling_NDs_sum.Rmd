```

The PCB names provided in the data incorporate both the number of chlorines and
the PCB congener number,  The official IUPAC names are available, but would be
impenetrable to most State of the Bay readers.  This table does provide more
terms under which to look for screening levels under the squirt tables. But the
SQUIRTS  do not contain screening levels for specific PCBs in marine sediments,
only for the SUM of PCBs.

## Chemical Parameters.
Here's the list of PCBs extracted and analyzed by Stantec/Campbell.
```{r find_chem_names}
fn <- 'working_data.xls'

PCBs_names <- read_excel(paste(sibling,fn, sep='/'), sheet = "PCBs", skip = 3) %>%
  select(1) %>%
  slice(1:22) #%>%
PCBs_names <- PCBs_names$PARAMETER_NAME
cat(do.call(paste, c(as.list(PCBs_names),sep = ', ')))
```

## Extract PCBs Data Only
We filter down to selected parameters defined by that list of chemicals.  The 
second and third filters remove some QA/QC samples.

We have some duplicate samples:
1.  For CSP-6 and CSP-15 - all measurements 
2.  CSP-10 - TOC data only - and
3.  CSP-9 - all observations EXCEPT TOC

For this analysis we calculate average values across the duplicate samples.

Notice that data are far from normal, even after transformation.  And
non-detects frequently outnumber the detects.  For detailed statistical analysis
it may be valuable to evaluate total detections and total estimated PCB loads.

## Question about Reporting Limits
The pattern of the reporting limits appears odd.  It looks like the same
detection limits were assigned to all compounds within each sample. Usually, the
detection limits vary by compound. Note also that some PCBs were never detected.

## Create PCB Data
We load the data in a format that records both observed values and reporting
limits in a single data column, along with a second (logical) column that
indicates whether the value was observed or represents a detection limit.

```{r shape_pcb_data}
PCBs_data_long <- the_data %>% 
  filter (the_data$PARAMETER_NAME %in% PCBs_names) %>%
  filter(is.na(`%_RECOVERY`)) %>%
  filter(SAMPLE_ID != 'QC') %>%
  mutate(CONCENTRATION = ifelse(is.na(CONCENTRATION) & LAB_QUALIFIER == 'U',
                                REPORTING_LIMIT, CONCENTRATION)) %>%
  group_by(SAMPLE_ID, PARAMETER_NAME) %>%
  summarize(CONCENTRATION = mean(CONCENTRATION, na.rm=TRUE),
            samples = n(),
            censored = sum(LAB_QUALIFIER=='U', na.rm=TRUE),
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  rename(PCB = PARAMETER_NAME) %>%
  mutate(PCB = factor(PCB)) %>%
  mutate(PCB = reorder(PCB, CONCENTRATION, function(x) mean(x, na.rm=TRUE)))

sum(PCBs_data_long$censored> 0 & PCBs_data_long$censored<PCBs_data_long$samples)
```
That zero shows that replicate samples are either all detects or all non-detects.

## A Problem
```{r show_problem}
tmp <- PCBs_data_long %>%
  group_by(SAMPLE_ID) %>%
  summarize(totPCBs = sum(CONCENTRATION, na.rm = TRUE),
            countPCBs = sum(censored==0, na.rm=TRUE),
            .groups = 'drop')

plt <- ggplot(tmp, aes(totPCBs, countPCBs)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(aes(label = SAMPLE_ID),nudge_y = .5, nudge_x = .1) +
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  xlab('Log Total PCBs (ppb)') +
  ylab('Number of PCBs observed') +
  theme_cbep(base_size = 12) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank()) 
plt
rm(tmp)
```
The data for CSP-8 includes high values for ALL PCBs, however, those high values 
are all flagged as non-detects.

Looking at the raw data, it is clear the reporting limits are sky high for this 
one site (almost two order of magnitude higher than for other sites), so this 
provides us with no useful information about contaminants in the field.  It is 
worth noting that the limits for most other organic contaminants are similarly 
high. This suggests we should drop this site from analyses of all organic 
contaminants.

We drop the site from further analysis.
```{r drop_csp8}
PCBs_data_long <- PCBs_data_long %>%
  filter(SAMPLE_ID != 'CSP-8')
```

## Final Data Set
```{r final_data}
lvls <- PCBs_data_long %>%
  group_by(SAMPLE_ID) %>%
  summarize(totPCBs = sum(CONCENTRATION, na.rm = TRUE),
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  mutate(SAMPLE_ID = factor(SAMPLE_ID, levels = SAMPLE_ID[order(totPCBs)])) %>%
  pull(SAMPLE_ID) %>%
  levels()

PCBs_data_long <- PCBs_data_long %>%
  mutate(SAMPLE_ID = factor(SAMPLE_ID, levels = lvls))

rm(lvls)
```

# Exploratory Graphics
## PCBs by Site
Censored values ("non-detects") have yellow boxes.  Uncensored values have black 
outlines.
```{r pcbs_by_site, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5} 
plt <- ggplot(PCBs_data_long, aes(SAMPLE_ID, CONCENTRATION)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = PCB, color = censored>0)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c('black', 'yellow')) +
  xlab('Site ID') +
  ylab('Concentration (ppb)') +
  theme_cbep(base_size = 10) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
plt
```

## Sites by PCBs
```{r sites_by_pcbs,  fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5} 
plt <- ggplot(PCBs_data_long, aes(PCB, CONCENTRATION)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = SAMPLE_ID, color = censored>0), lwd = 1) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c('black', 'yellow'), name = 'Censored') +
  xlab('PCB') +
  ylab('Concentration (ppb)') +
  theme_cbep(base_size = 10) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank()) +
  theme(legend.key.size = unit(.15, 'in'))
plt
```
So, the mix of PCBs varies plot to plot quite a bit.  Most non-detects happened 
at a handful of sites, where they tended to happen for multiple PCBs.

# Correlations
We can look at correlations, but they are not all that informative, because of
the large number of non-detects.  It is better here to conduct analyses using
methods that address the non--detects explicitly.  But to a first approximation,
note that the correlation coefficients are high between almost all PCBs.  Some
of that, unfortunately, reflects the identical detection limits for all
compounds reported by the laboratory.

```{r correlations}
PCBs_data_long %>%
  pivot_wider(id_cols = SAMPLE_ID,
              names_from = 'PCB',
              values_from = 'CONCENTRATION') %>%
  select(-SAMPLE_ID) %>%
  cor(method = 'spearman') %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

# Analysis of Non Detects
Here we continue the analysis with an explicit effort to model the non-detects.
We do this, as elsewhere, using a simple maximum likelihood estimation procedure
to calculate an estimated distribution for each contaminant, and then replace
the NDs with an estimate of the conditional mean suggested by those
concentrations.

## Distributional graphics
What kind of distribution do we actually have?
```{r distribution_graphic}
plt <- ggplot(PCBs_data_long, aes(PCB, CONCENTRATION)) +
  geom_violin() +
  geom_point(aes(color = censored>0), alpha = 0.2, size=2) +
  scale_y_log10() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90))
  
plt
```
So, the bulk of our data lies in censored values, which themselves varied from
site to site. There is far too little data here to determine a distribution for
these data, but a lognormal or Gamma distribution are both likely, give the
constraint that values can not be lower than zero. Here we use a lognormal
distribution, largely for its simplicity.

# Alternate Estimates of Sum of PCBs

We want to focus on analysis of the sum of PCBs, because all PCBs are highly
correlated, and the SQUIRT tables provide screening criteria for the sum of PCBs. 

The question is, how do we best handle the non-detects.  Often in environmental
analyses, non-detects are replaced by zero, by the detection limit, or by half
the detection limit, but none of those conventions rests on strong statistical
principals.  We instead implement a method that estimates the (unobserved) value
of non-detects using a conditional mean of censored observations derived from a
maximum likelihood procedure.

The idea is to fit a maximum likelihood model to the data assuming a censored
lognormal distribution.  With a lognormal density in hand, we can estimate a
conditional mean of for "unobserved" observations below a the detection limit by
sampling from the underlying lognormal distribution 1000 times (or more) and
calculating a mean.

We developed functions for implementing this procedure.  Those functions have 
been incorporated into a small package, 'LCensMeans' to facilitate use in CBEP 
State of the Bay Analyses.

See the help files in the LCensMeans package for more explanation, or read the 
R Notebook "Conditional Means of Censored Distributions", where we developed the 
basic approach.

The LCensMeans package is in active development in pre-release form, so there 
is no guarantee that the user interface will not change.  The following code 
worked as of July 2020.

## Applying to the PCBs Data
Note the use of "mutate"  after the group_by() so that the dataframe is not 
collapsed to the grouping variables, as it would be by summary().

The calculations involved are random, so if you want to get exactly the same 
results, you need to set the random number seed with set.seed()
```{r data_with_NDs}
dat2 <- PCBs_data_long %>%
  group_by(PCB) %>%
  mutate(LikCensored = sub_cmeans(CONCENTRATION, censored>0)) %>%
  mutate(HalfDL = ifelse(censored>0, CONCENTRATION/2, CONCENTRATION)) %>%
  ungroup()

res2 <- dat2 %>%
  group_by(SAMPLE_ID) %>%
  summarize(LNtotPCB = sum(LikCensored),
            halfDLtotPCB = sum(HalfDL),
            totPCB = sum(CONCENTRATION), 
            .groups='drop')
```

## Implications of Alternate Treatment of NDs
```{r NDs_graphic, fig.height = 8, fig.width = 10}
ggplot(dat2, aes(CONCENTRATION,LikCensored)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(aes(color = censored>0), alpha = 0.5) + 
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope= 1, alpha = 0.5, color = 'red') + 
  facet_wrap('PCB', scales = 'free') +
  theme_cbep(base_size = 8) +
  scale_color_manual(values = cbep_colors2(), name = 'Censored')

```
The first panel shows the meaningless scatter for a parameter with
no detections and variable detection limits. Note that the "corrected"
estimates are all small and only vary in the fourth decimal place, well below
differences that can possibly matter.  In general, that is the pattern we
observe -- chemicals with large numbers of non-detects tend to be present in low
concentrations, even in sites where they were detected.  Thus the non-detects
have relatively little effect on estimates of total PCBs.

# Impact of Selection of ND Method on Conclusions
```{r does_handling_of_nds_matter}
ggplot(res2, aes(x=totPCB))+
  geom_point(aes(y=LNtotPCB), color = 'orange') +
  geom_text(aes(y=LNtotPCB, label = SAMPLE_ID), color = 'orange', hjust = 0) +
  geom_point(aes(y=halfDLtotPCB), color = 'red') +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, lty = 2) +
  geom_text(aes(x=200, y=210, label = '1:1 Line'), angle = 35) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 22.7, color = 'blue', lty=3, size=1) +    #ERL
  geom_text(aes(x=250, y=30, label = 'ERL'), color = 'blue') +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 180, color = 'blue', lty=3, size=1) +     #ERM
  geom_text(aes(x=250, y=187, label = 'ERM'), color = 'blue') +
  xlab('Total, Assuming Detection Limit') +
  ylab('Total, Assuming half DL (red) or Max. Lik (orange)') +
  xlim(c(0,275)) +
  theme_cbep()
```
As expected, the maximum likelihood estimator is regularly lower than the "half 
of detection limit" method for these cases, where non-detects were frequent.

However, this makes little functional difference in qualitative conclusions,
because detections dominate the Total PCB values at each site.  The choice of
the estimator determines conclusions at only one site (site CSS-13), where the
site exceeds ERL if you replace NDs with half the detection limit, but does not
if you use the maximum likelihood approach.

# Conclusion
So, what do we have to show for this?  Slightly better estimates of total PCBs, 
for use in other graphics.
